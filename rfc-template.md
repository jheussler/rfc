This is a suggested template for ObjectivePHP Request for Comments (RFCs). 

Change this template to suit your RFC. Not all RFCs need to be tightly specified. 

Not all RFCs need all the sections below. Typically, the very first draft version of a RFC could contain the summary section only.

## Summary

The elevator pitch for the RFC. This first section should describe the big picture of the proposal: 

 - why are you thinking this would be an asset for the framework?
 - which problem does it solve?
 - and/or what feature does it provide.

Nevertheless, you're welcome to submit a complete RFC at first commit.

## Proposal

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
> "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
> interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
